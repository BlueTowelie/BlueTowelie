Hi I'm BlueTowel, @BlueTowelie on here

I'm working on a Unity game and a web app and a mod of a Pokémon fangame called Pokémon Reborn: Plates of Arceus (the fangame is called Pokémon Reborn, the mod is called Plates of Arceus)
Okay! Yes. You're probably here about the last one.
This is here to help coordinate collaborative work on the mod from the team working on it and the community in general.

You can reach me on Discord (bluetowel#6318) or the Pokémon Reborn forums (BlueTowel)
